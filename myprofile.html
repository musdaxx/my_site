        Hello, I am Musdax. I am someone who is interested in becoming an
        offensive ethical hacker and programmer. Right now, I am learning
        Python, CSS, HTML, and in the future, I want to learn C, Java,
        JavaScript, Lua, and Rust. I am also proficient with Linux; the distro I
        am using is Kali Linux by Offensive Security. Additionally, I am
        learning German and Korean. In the future, I want to learn Russian or
        italian. I like the history of the world, especially the history of war.
        my favourite anime's is heaven's memo pad, spy x family, and girls und
        panzer.
